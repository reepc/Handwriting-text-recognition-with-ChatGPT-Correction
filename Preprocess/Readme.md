The Line_removal.py is modified from a github repo: https://github.com/UtkuKaradeniz/Ruling-Line-Removal/tree/master

And the reference of segment methods are write below their class.

Line removal is to remove the ruling lines on your image but it's still have some problem that it can't remove correctly sometimes. Will improve in future.

Thresholding is from the binary method mentioned in the paper:[Line Segmentation from Unconstrained Handwritten Text Images using Adaptive Approach](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2104/2104.08777.pdf)
It is also a segment method I had tried to do but not implemented. 

The segment is not very good but can segment basic image like image below.
